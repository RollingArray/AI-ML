    "## What is the t-test for paired samples?\n",
    "The dependent samples T-test (or paired samples t-test) is a statistical test that determines whether there is a difference between two dependent groups or samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependent samples T-test, or also known as the dependent t-test, tests whether the mean values of two dependent groups differ significantly from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Paired T-Test](images/paired_t-Test.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do you need the dependent t-Test?\n",
    "You need the paired t-test whenever you survey the same group or sample at two points in time. For example, you might be interested in whether a rehabilitation program has a positive effect on physical fitness. Since you can't ask all the people who go to rehab, you use a random sample. You can then use the paired t-test to infer the population from the sample.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Dependent Samples t-test\n",
    "### What are dependent or paired samples?\n",
    "In dependent samples, these measured values are available in pairs. The pairs result from repeated measurements, parallelization or matching. This can be the case, for example, in longitudinal studies with several measurement points (time series analyses) or in intervention studies with experimental designs (before-after measurement).\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of dependent sampling is when the weight of a group of people is measured at two points in time. A person can then be uniquely assigned a weight at the first and second measurement time points and the difference in the measured values can be calculated in each case. If more than two measurement times are available, ANOVA with repeated measures is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the advantage of a dependent t-test over an independent t-test?\n",
    "The question of whether to use a dependent t-test or an independent t-test is, of course, already determined as part of the study design, and it is not possible to arbitrarily use either one test or the other. Therefore, the question is rather which type of study makes more sense:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conducting a study with one group of participants who are measured twice.\n",
    "To conduct a study with two separate groups of participants, each measured once.\n",
    "The major advantage of a repeated-measures design that then uses the paired t-test is that individual differences between participants can be eliminated. This means that the probability of detecting a (statistically significant) difference, if one exists, is higher with the paired t-test than with the independent t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Dependent sample T-Test](images/dependent t-test-vs-independent t-test.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses\n",
    "Now the hypothesis can be derived from the question. In the hypothesis, a preliminary, i.e. unsubstantiated, assumption is made which is to be tested. In the case of a t test for dependent samples, the hypotheses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null hypothesis H0: The mean value of the two dependent groups is equal.\n",
    "- Alternative hypothesis H1: The mean values of the two dependent groups are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions paired t-Test\n",
    "Of course, the assumptions must be checked before calculating the paired t-test. If the prerequisites 2 and 3 (listed below) are not fulfilled, the Wilcoxon test must be used. The Wilcoxon test is the non-parametric counterpart of the paired t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. There are two dependent groups or samples\n",
    "As the name paired t-test already suggests the groups must be dependent, i.e. a value of one group must relate to a value of the other group.\n",
    "\n",
    " The weight of one and the same person is measured before and after a diet.\n",
    " Researchers measure the weight of people who have been on a diet and people who have not.\n",
    "### 2. The variables are interval scaled\n",
    "In the t-test for dependent samples, the difference between the two dependent values is calculated and then the mean value. This only makes sense if the values are metric\n",
    "\n",
    " The salary of a person (in Euro)\n",
    " The educational level of a person\n",
    "### 3. The differences of the paired values are normally distributed.\n",
    "The difference between the paired values must be normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    " The difference from the weight of one person at two points in time.\n",
    " The difference in the number of points after throwing two dice."

    "It is claimed that sports-car owners drive on the average 18580 kms per year. A consumer firm believes that the average milage is probably higher. To check, the consumer firm obtained information from randomly selected 10 sports-car owners that resulted in a sample mean of 17352 kms with a sample standard deviation of 2012 kms. What can be concluded about this claim at\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "To test the claim about the average mileage of sports-car owners, we can conduct a one-sample t-test. Here's how we can approach the problem:\n",

    "- Sample mean ($ \\bar{X} $) = 17352 kms\n",
    "- Sample standard deviation ($ s $) = 2012 kms\n",
    "- Sample size ($ n $) = 10\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$ t = \\frac{{\\bar{X} - \\mu}}{{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "### (a) At 5% level of significance:\n",
    "For a one-tailed test (since the consumer firm believes the average mileage is higher), we'll find the critical value from the t-distribution table with 9 degrees of freedom (since $ n - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9 $) and a 5% significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\text{Critical value} = t_{\\alpha, df} $\n",

    "Let's calculate the t-value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ t = \\frac{{17352 - 18580}}{{\\frac{2012}{\\sqrt{10}}}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ t \\approx \\frac{{-1228}}{{\\frac{2012}{\\sqrt{10}}}} $\n",

    "\n",
    "$ t \\approx -4.36 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's a one-tailed test and we're testing if the mean is higher, we compare the calculated t-value with the critical value:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $ t \\leq t_{\\alpha, df} $, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- If $ t > t_{\\alpha, df} $, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the t-distribution table, $ t_{0.05, 9} \\approx 1.833 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $ -4.36 < -1.833 $, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (b) At 1% level of significance:\n",
    "Similarly, for a one-tailed test, we'll find the critical value from the t-distribution table with 9 degrees of freedom and a 1% significance level.\n",

    "$ t \\approx -4.36 $\n",

    "From the t-distribution table, $ t_{0.01, 9} \\approx 2.821 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $ -4.36 < -2.821 $, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "In both cases (at 5% and 1% significance levels), we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we have sufficient evidence to conclude that the consumer firm's claim is justified: the average mileage of sports-car owners is likely higher than 18580 kms per year."

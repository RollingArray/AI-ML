    "# F-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-test is a statistical test that's used to compare the variances of two populations or more. It's particularly useful when you want to determine if the variances of two sets of data are significantly different from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have two groups of data, let's say Group A and Group B. You want to know if the variability within Group A is significantly different from the variability within Group B. The F-test helps you do just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the F-test works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The null hypothesis in an F-test states that the variances of the two groups are equal. So, if you're comparing Group A and Group B, the null hypothesis would be that the variance of Group A equals the variance of Group B. \n",
    "\n",
    "   $H_0: \\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_2^2 = \\ldots = \\sigma_k^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "   The null hypothesis states that the variances of all populations (groups) being compared are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The alternative hypothesis in an F-test is that the variances are not equal. So, in our example, it would mean that the variance of Group A is significantly different from the variance of Group B.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $H_1: \\text{{At least one variance is different}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "   The alternative hypothesis suggests that at least one of the population variances is different from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **F-statistic Formula**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The F-statistic is calculated as the ratio of the variances of the groups involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $ F = \\frac{{\\text{{Between-group variance}}}}{{\\text{{Within-group variance}}}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "   For two groups (often denoted as Group A and Group B), the F-statistic formula becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $ F = \\frac{{s_1^2}}{{s_2^2}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $s_1^2$ and $s_2^2$ are the sample variances of Group A and Group B, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For multiple groups, the formula becomes more complex, but it essentially compares the variability between groups to the variability within groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **F-distribution and Critical Value**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   After calculating the F-statistic, you compare it to a critical value from the F-distribution table. This critical value depends on the significance level (Î±) chosen and the degrees of freedom associated with each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decision Rule**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If $F > F_{\\text{critical}}$, you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This suggests that at least one of the population variances is different from the others.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - If $F \\leq F_{\\text{critical}}$, you fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is not enough evidence to conclude that the population variances are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Assumptions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The data within each group are independent and identically distributed.\n",
    "   - The populations from which the samples are drawn are normally distributed.\n",
    "   - Homogeneity of variances: The variances within each group are approximately equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential to note that violating these assumptions can lead to unreliable results from the F-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the F-test compares the ratio of variances between groups to within groups to determine if there are significant differences in variability. It's a powerful tool for comparing variances in multiple groups simultaneously."

    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The variability in the amount of impurities present in a batch of chemicals used for a particular process is hypothesized to depend on the length of time that the process is in operation. A new process has been developed with the aim of reducing the variability of impurities compared to the original process. To test this hypothesis, samples are taken from both the original process and the new process, and their variabilities are compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- Sample 1 (Original Process): Sample size $(n$) = 25, Sample variance $(S^2$) = 1.04\n",
    "- Sample 2 (New Process): Sample size $(n$) = 25, Sample variance $(S^2$) = 0.51\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "To determine whether the variability in the new process is significantly less than the variability in the original process, with a significance level of 5%."

    "## Solution \n",
    "To solve this problem, we'll use the F-test to compare the variability (variance) of impurities between the two processes. Let's break down the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Hypotheses**:\n",
    "   - Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): The variability in the new process is the same as the variability in the original process.\n",
    "     $ H_0: \\sigma_{\\text{new}}^2 = \\sigma_{\\text{original}}^2 $\n",
    "   - Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): The variability in the new process is less than the variability in the original process.\n",
    "     $ H_1: \\sigma_{\\text{new}}^2 < \\sigma_{\\text{original}}^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Test Statistic (F-statistic)**:\n",
    "   We'll use the formula for the F-statistic:\n",
    "   $ F = \\frac{{\\text{Variability of new process}}}{{\\text{Variability of original process}}} $\n",
    "   $ F = \\frac{{0.51}}{{1.04}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determine Critical Value**:\n",
    "   Since we're testing at a significance level of 5%, we need to find the critical value from the F-distribution table. The degrees of freedom for both samples are the sample sizes minus 1, so $df_1 = df_2 = 25 - 1 = 24$. We're interested in the lower tail of the F-distribution because we want to determine if the variability in the new process is less. Therefore, we'll find the critical value for a one-tailed test at the 5% level of significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compare F-statistic to Critical Value**:\n",
    "   If the F-statistic is less than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's proceed with the calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $ F = \\frac{{0.51}}{{1.04}} \\approx 0.4904 $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From the F-distribution table (or using statistical software), with $df_1 = df_2 = 24$ and a significance level of 5%, the critical value is approximately $F_{0.05}(24, 24) = 0.509$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Since $0.4904 < 0.509$, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: At the 5% significance level, there is enough evidence to conclude that the variability in the new process is less than the variability in the original process. Therefore, the new process seems to have successfully reduced the variability of impurities compared to the original process."

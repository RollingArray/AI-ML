    "Propositional logic, also known as sentential logic or propositional calculus, is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with propositionsâ€”statements that are either true or false. It provides a way to analyze and manipulate complex statements using logical operators. These operators allow us to combine or modify propositions to form new ones. Let's delve into the key components and concepts of propositional logic with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Propositions:\n",
    "\n",
    "A proposition is a declarative sentence that can be either true or false, but not both. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ P $: \"It is raining.\"\n",
    "- $ Q $: \"The sun is shining.\"\n",
    "- $ R $: \"2 + 2 = 4.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Logical Operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators are symbols used to connect propositions to form compound propositions. The basic logical operators are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Negation ($ \\neg $):\n",
    "This operator is used to represent the negation or denial of a proposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If $ P $ represents \"It is raining,\" then $ \\neg P $ represents \"It is not raining.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Conjunction ($ \\land $):\n",
    "This operator represents the logical AND operation, where the compound proposition is true only if both individual propositions are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If $ P $ represents \"It is raining,\" and $ Q $ represents \"The sun is shining,\" then $ P \\land Q $ represents \"It is raining and the sun is shining.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. Disjunction ($ \\lor $):\n",
    "This operator represents the logical OR operation, where the compound proposition is true if at least one of the individual propositions is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If $ P $ represents \"It is raining,\" and $ Q $ represents \"The sun is shining,\" then $ P \\lor Q $ represents \"It is raining or the sun is shining.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. Implication ($ \\rightarrow $):\n",
    "This operator represents the material implication, where the compound proposition is false only if the first proposition is true and the second proposition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If $ P $ represents \"It is raining,\" and $ Q $ represents \"The streets are wet,\" then $ P \\rightarrow Q $ represents \"If it is raining, then the streets are wet.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e. Biconditional ($ \\leftrightarrow $):\n",
    "This operator represents the logical equivalence, where the compound proposition is true if both individual propositions have the same truth value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If $ P $ represents \"It is raining,\" and $ Q $ represents \"The streets are wet,\" then $ P \\leftrightarrow Q $ represents \"It is raining if and only if the streets are wet.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Truth Tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Truth tables are used to display all possible truth values of a compound proposition based on the truth values of its constituent propositions. Each row in a truth table represents a combination of truth values for the propositions involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's construct a truth table for the compound proposition $ P \\land Q $:\n",
    "\n",
    "| $ P $ | $ Q $ | $ P \\land Q $ |\n",
    "|-------|-------|-------------|\n",
    "|   T   |   T   |      T      |\n",
    "|   T   |   F   |      F      |\n",
    "|   F   |   T   |      F      |\n",
    "|   F   |   F   |      F      |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Laws of Propositional Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several laws and rules governing the manipulation and simplification of compound propositions. Some common ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Commutative Laws**: $ P \\land Q \\equiv Q \\land P $ and $ P \\lor Q \\equiv Q \\lor P $\n",
    "- **Associative Laws**: $ (P \\land Q) \\land R \\equiv P \\land (Q \\land R) $ and $ (P \\lor Q) \\lor R \\equiv P \\lor (Q \\lor R) $\n",
    "- **Distributive Laws**: $ P \\land (Q \\lor R) \\equiv (P \\land Q) \\lor (P \\land R) $ and $ P \\lor (Q \\land R) \\equiv (P \\lor Q) \\land (P \\lor R) $\n",
    "- **De Morgan's Laws**: $ \\neg (P \\land Q) \\equiv \\neg P \\lor \\neg Q $ and $ \\neg (P \\lor Q) \\equiv \\neg P \\land \\neg Q $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Let's consider the following propositions:\n",
    "- $ P $: \"It is raining.\"\n",
    "- $ Q $: \"The streets are wet.\"\n",
    "- $ R $: \"There is heavy traffic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's construct compound propositions and truth tables for them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $ P \\land Q $: \"It is raining and the streets are wet.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "| $ P $ | $ Q $ | $ P \\land Q $ |\n",
    "|-------|-------|-------------|\n",
    "|   T   |   T   |      T      |\n",
    "|   T   |   F   |      F      |\n",
    "|   F   |   T   |      F      |\n",
    "|   F   |   F   |      F      |\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $ Q \\lor R $: \"The streets are wet or there is heavy traffic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "| $ Q $ | $ R $ | $ Q \\lor R $ |\n",
    "|-------|-------|-------------|\n",
    "|   T   |   T   |      T      |\n",
    "|   T   |   F   |      T      |\n",
    "|   F   |   T   |      T      |\n",
    "|   F   |   F   |      F      |\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few basic concepts and examples of propositional logic. It's a fundamental aspect of logical reasoning and finds extensive applications in computer science, mathematics, philosophy, and various other fields."

    "## Inference : Properties\n",
    "Certainly! Let's discuss these properties of inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Entailment ($ \\alpha \\, \\Vdash \\, \\beta $):\n",
    "\n",
    "Entailment represents a relationship between logical statements, where one statement logically implies another. If $ \\alpha \\, \\Vdash \\, \\beta $, it means that whenever $ \\alpha $ is true, $ \\beta $ must also be true. In other words, the truth of $ \\alpha $ guarantees the truth of $ \\beta $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If $ \\alpha $ represents \"It is raining,\" and $ \\beta $ represents \"The streets are wet,\" then $ \\alpha \\, \\Vdash \\, \\beta $ implies that whenever it is raining, the streets must be wet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Equivalence ($ \\alpha \\equiv \\beta $):\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalence refers to a bidirectional relationship between logical statements, where each statement implies the other. If $ \\alpha \\equiv \\beta $, it means that $ \\alpha $ entails $ \\beta $ and $ \\beta $ entails $ \\alpha $. In other words, the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of the other, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If $ \\alpha $ represents \"It is raining,\" and $ \\beta $ represents \"The streets are wet,\" then $ \\alpha \\equiv \\beta $ implies that it is raining if and only if the streets are wet, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Validity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Validity refers to the property of an argument where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. An argument is valid if there is no possible situation in which the premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "- Premise 1: All humans are mortal. ($ \\alpha $)\n",
    "- Premise 2: Socrates is a human. ($ \\beta $)\n",
    "- Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal. ($ \\gamma $)\n",
    "\n",
    "If premises 1 and 2 are true, the conclusion must also be true. Hence, the argument is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Satisfiability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Satisfiability refers to the property of a logical formula or set of formulas where there exists at least one assignment of truth values to its variables that makes the formula(s) true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "- $ \\alpha \\lor \\neg \\alpha $ (This formula is always true regardless of the truth value of $ \\alpha $)\n",
    "- $ \\beta \\land \\neg \\beta $ (This formula is always false regardless of the truth value of $ \\beta $)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both examples demonstrate satisfiability: there exists at least one assignment of truth values to the variables that makes the formulas true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these properties is fundamental in logical reasoning and is extensively used in various fields such as mathematics, computer science, and philosophy."
